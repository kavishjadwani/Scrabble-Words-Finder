ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,

ANY OTHER NOTES FOR THE GRADER:
In my approach, I have  used a map for my anagram dictionary and hence 
my AnagramDictionary will find all the anagrams of one String in time linear 
in the size of the output set (plus time to sort the letters in the String given).
I have a helper method called frequencyOfWords in my main class. This method will 
give the frequency of characters in a word. This method is useful because once we 
know frequency of characters, we can generate unique string and multiplicity array 
which form our input for the rack class.
